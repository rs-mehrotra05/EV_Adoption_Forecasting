# EV_Adoption_Forecasting
As electric vehicle (EV) adoption surges, urban planners need to anticipate infrastructure needsâ€”especially charging stations. Inadequate planning can lead to bottlenecks, impacting user satisfaction and hindering sustainability goals.

Problem Statement: Using the electric vehicle dataset (which includes information on EV populations, vehicle types, and possibly historical charging usage), create a model to forecast future EV adoption. For example, predict the number of electric vehicles in upcoming years based on the trends in the data.

Goal: Build a regression model that forecasts future EV adoption demand based on historical trends in EV growth, types of vehicles, and regional data.
